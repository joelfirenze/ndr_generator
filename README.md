Creating a text generator using the content of Singapore's National Day Rally
This is a exploratory project to create a limited 'speech generator' based on the content of Singapore's National Day Rally. 
Please do not take this speech generator seriously; the text generated from this model has limited coherence owing to the limited training material. Nonetheless, enjoy the 'wisdom' generated from the trained model.
